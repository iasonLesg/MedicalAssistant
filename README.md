⚠️Important Notice

Upon first launch after installation, you will be prompted to set an encryption password.
This password is used to encrypt and access your patient data each time you open the application.

🔐 Do not forget this password.
    There is no recovery mechanism if it is lost, as all data is encrypted locally for your privacy.

🔄 Resetting the Application

If you forget your password or need to reset the application:

    Navigate to the following directory on your system:

C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\MedicalAssistant

Delete the file named:

    patients.json

    This will remove all existing patient data and allow you to start fresh on next launch.

🌐 Changing the Language

To change the selected language:

    In the same directory:

C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\MedicalAssistant

Delete the file:

languagesetup.txt

Restart the application. You will be prompted to choose a new language.
